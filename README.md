Welcome to the BE 500: Differential Equations for Bioengineers course.

Differential equations are powerful mathematical tools used to model and analyze dynamic systems that change over time.
In bioengineering, these equations play a critical role in understanding biological processes, medical systems, and
complex interactions within living organisms. This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of
differential equations and their applications in bioengineering, bridging mathematics with real-world problem-solving.

This course provides both theoretical and practical knowledge about modeling biological and medical phenomena using
ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs). Students will learn analytical, numerical, and graphical
methods to solve these equations and interpret their results in the context of bioengineering challenges. The course
emphasizes hands-on experience with computational tools like MATLAB or Python to simulate and visualize solutions,
enabling students to tackle problems in areas such as population dynamics, pharmacokinetics, biomechanics, and neural
modeling.

By integrating foundational calculus principles with advanced modeling techniques, this course equips students with the
skills to address complex bioengineering problems through the lens of differential equations. It also lays the
groundwork for further exploration into advanced topics such as stochastic and nonlinear systems, preparing students for
future research and innovation in the field.

## Code

All code used in the lectures will be available in this GitHub
repository (https://github.com/HossamBalaha/BE-500-Introduction-to-Differential-Equations-for-Bioengineers) in
the "MATLAB" and "Python" folders.

## Requirements

Python dependencies used by the lecture scripts are listed in `requirements.txt` at the project root.
Install them into your environment with the following command from the project root.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The following example shows how to run one of the Python lecture scripts on Windows using `cmd.exe`.
This example runs `Lecture_01_Lab_Exercise_1_Differentiation.py` which computes a symbolic derivative and plots the
results.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended for isolation).

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the project dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the lecture script from the project root.

```bash
python Python\Lecture_01_Lab_Exercise_1_Differentiation.py
```

Notes.

- Replace the script path to run other lecture examples, for example `Python\Lecture_01_Lab_Exercise_2_Integration.py`.
- On non-Windows shells (PowerShell, macOS, Linux), adjust the virtual environment activation command accordingly.
